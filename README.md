# Sequelize_Associations

The biggest difficulty I have encountered is the management of database relationships. While sequelize presents itself as an essential ORM of Node.JS, the documentation and resources that can be found often leave much to be desired. Thatâ€™s why after spending a lot of time managing this relationship, I decided to write this article in order to detail the implementation of all types of relationships possible thanks to Sequelize.

This repo is a set of tutorials showing concrete examples of how the ORM works with defining associations and querying based on those associations.
